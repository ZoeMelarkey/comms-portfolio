I'm a passionate communicator who thrives on bringing stories to life and building teams that make a real impact. With expertise in leading communications in fast-paced, complex environments, I know how to cut through the noise, build engagement, and shape brands in a way that truly resonates. For me, delivering excellence in communications is always about the people – empowering teams, creating space for them to thrive, and delivering meaningful results together.
For the last three years, I've headed up all aspects of Communications at Ocado Retail – financial, corporate and consumer PR, brand social, and internal comms. Here are just a few examples of the work I've done during that time:
