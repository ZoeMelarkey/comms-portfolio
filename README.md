# Communications Portfolio
I’m an award-winning communications leader with a track record of shaping impactful, people-first campaigns across corporate, consumer, brand and internal comms. I thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments, turning complex challenges into powerful stories that drive engagement and deliver results.
For the past three years, I’ve led all aspects of Communications at Ocado Retail – from high-profile financial and corporate PR to consumer storytelling and social media.
Here are a few examples of the work I’ve done during that time:
